title: Learn TDD in Ember

{% include tutorial-intro.md %}

To see how TDD works in Ember, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Ember 2.6 and Mocha, a popular test framework for Ember. Each section of the article is linked to a corresponding commit in the [Git repo](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/ember) that shows the process step-by-step.

The feature we'll build is the age-old tutorial feature: creating a blog post.
