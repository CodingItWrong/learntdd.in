{% include tutorial-intro.md %}

To see how TDD works in Ember, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Ember 3.7 and its built-in testing tools, along with [Mirage](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com/) for setting up an artificial backend server. Each section of the article is linked to a corresponding commit in the [Git repo](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/ember) that shows the process step-by-step. This tutorial assumes you have some [familiarity with Ember](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/) and with [automated testing concepts](/concepts).

The feature we'll build is the age-old tutorial feature: creating a blog post.
