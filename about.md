The goal of this site is to make it easy for anyone to learn Test-Driven Development in their framework of choice. This is great if you:

- Are new to programming and want to learn good testing practices from the start.
- Want to be able to easily try out TDD to see its value without having to learn a separate programming language.
- Want to evaluate a framework to see how conducive it is to TDD.
- Want to learn best-practices for how to approach TDD in a framework.

Sound good? Then [pick a framework](/) and let's get started!

The [classic](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) [works](http://www.informit.com/store/growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests-9780321503626) on test-driven development can't be surpassed when it comes to theory. But their examples are written in Java, which can make it difficult to figure out how to apply TDD to other languages and frameworks. Once you've seen TDD in action, you'll be ready to drill more into the theory.

## Contribute

You can contribute to Learn TDD by:

- Submitting links to articles, videos, and books on Test-Driven Development for a framework.
- Suggest changes to one of our [Learn TDD Git repos](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in) by [forking it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), for things like:
  - Correcting errors.
  - Improving practices to framework standards.
  - Updating to a newer version of the framework.
- Creating a Learn TDD Git repo that walks through building a simple CRUD feature in a different framework using TDD.
