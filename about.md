The goal of this site is to make it easy for anyone to learn Test-Driven Development in their framework of choice. The [classic](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) [works](http://www.informit.com/store/growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests-9780321503626) on test-driven development are written in Java. This means that if you want to do Test-Driven Development from the start of using a new framework, you may need to learn:

- The framework itself.
- The language the framework is in.
- Java.
- The concepts of Test-Driven Development.
- How to apply these concepts in the framework.

That's a lot at once! But if someone can walk you through an example of test-driven development in the framework you're learning, that's a lot easier to get started.

Learning TDD is great if you:

- Are new to programming and want to learn good testing practices from the start.
- Want to evaluate a framework to see how conducive it is to do TDD.
- Want to learn best-practices for how to approach TDD in a framework.

Sound good? Then [pick a framework](/) and let's get started!
