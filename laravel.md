title: Learn TDD in Laravel
---

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an approach to automated software testing that involves writing a failing test before writing the production code to make it pass. TDD helps you develop a robust test suite to catch bugs, as well as guiding you to more modular, flexible code.

To see how TDD works in Laravel, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Laravel's built-in TestCase base class, which is built on top of the PHPUnit test framework. To follow along, take a look at the [Git repository](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/laravel) -- the commits show the process step-by-step.
