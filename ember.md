title: Learn TDD in Ember
---

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an approach to automated software testing that involves writing a failing test before writing the production code to make it pass. TDD helps you develop a robust test suite to catch bugs, as well as guiding you to more modular, flexible code.

To see how TDD works in Ember, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Mocha, a popular test framework for Ember. To follow along, take a look at the [Git repository](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/ember) -- the commits show the process step-by-step.
