{% include tutorial-intro.md %}

To see how TDD works in Rails, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using RSpec, one of the most popular test frameworks for Ruby. Each section of the article is linked to a corresponding commit in the [Git repo](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/rails) that shows the process step-by-step.

The feature we'll build is the age-old tutorial feature: creating a blog post. Right away we run into a question:

To learn more about TDD, I recommend reading [*Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests*](http://www.informit.com/store/growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests-9780321503626). It's the original work on the style of TDD we describe here, mockist TDD.
