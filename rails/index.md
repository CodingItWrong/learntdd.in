title: Learn TDD in Rails

{% include tutorial-intro.md %}

To see how TDD works in Rails, let's walk through a simple real-world example of building a feature. We'll be using Rails 5.0 and RSpec, one of the most popular test frameworks for Ruby. Each section of the article is linked to a corresponding commit in the [Git repo](https://github.com/learn-tdd-in/rails) that shows the process step-by-step.

The feature we'll build is the age-old tutorial feature: creating a blog post.
