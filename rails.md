title: Learn TDD in Rails
---

To help you learn Test-Driven Development in Rails, we've created a sample project that walks you through the TDD process. Because it's a Git repository, the commits show the process step-by-step.

[Check out the Learn TDD in Rails project!](https://github.com/learntdd/learn-tdd-in-rails)

Another good resource for learning TDD in Rails is [*The RSpec Book*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356379/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_j8kqxbN1WK6G3). It uses an older versions of RSpec, so it's best to read it once you already have some familiarity with RSpec so you're familiar with the necessary adjustments. It's also currently out of print, but you can get paperback or Kindle copies on Amazon.
